#  Adidas USA Sales 

the problem:
A startup company after collecting a number of revenues and expenses during the months

We need to know the answers to a number of questions that make important decisions based on intuition data, including:

• We achieved the highest revenue in America?
• In the same month what is the American amount per day?
• In what month was the amount of expenses?
• In the same month what is the quantity for each day?
• In the same month the rate of change every day?
• What is the rate of change month by month?
• What is America's total per week?
